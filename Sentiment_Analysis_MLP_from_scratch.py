"""
Implementation of Sentiment Analysis of IDMb Movie Reviews with a Custom Neural Network
Developed an end-to-end sentiment analysis solution for classifying IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative
This project's core involved implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network entirely from scratch in Python
The pipeline integrated robust natural language processing (NLP) for text preprocessing, encompassing cleaning and advanced linguistic analysis using spaCy for efficient tokenization, lemmatization, and stop word removal
Processed text was then transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), preparing the data for the custom-built model
Model training involved optimizing the custom MLP using mini-batch gradient descent, with performance monitored across training, validation, and test datasets

    NOTE: TD-IDF is a numerical statistic used in information retrieval and text mining to reflect the importance of a word to a document in a collection or corpus

    When TfidfVectorizer processes a corpus of text, it identifies all unique words or n-grams.
    It then calculates the term frequency (how often each word appears) across the entire corpus.
    If max_features is specified, the vectorizer will select only the top max_features words based on their term frequency, effectively limiting the size of the vocabulary.
    max_feature can be adjusted based on the size of our training set (X_train) so that the model can capture a broad no.of highly frequent unique words or n-grams to avoid underfitting.
